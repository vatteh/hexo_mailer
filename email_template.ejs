  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= monthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
    my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Look at my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i< latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].id %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %> </a></li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Talk soon,<br>
    Victor
